This repository is dedicated to my LeetCode practice and preparation for coding interviews, specifically focused on Python. It serves as a record of my daily problem-solving progress, with organized solutions by topic and difficulty level.

## Goals
- Solve at least one problem per day to build consistency and improve problem-solving skills.
- Cover a wide range of topics, including arrays, strings, hash tables, dynamic programming, and more.
- Track progress in `Progress.md` and reflect on weekly challenges and learnings in `Summary.md`.
